# Integer-Valued Basic Functions

This chapter describes Stan's built-in function that take various
types of arguments and return results of type integer.

## Integer-Valued Arithmetic Operators {#int-arithmetic}

Stan's arithmetic is based on standard double-precision  C++ integer
and floating-point arithmetic.  If the arguments to an arithmetic
operator are both integers, as in `2 + 2`, integer arithmetic is used.
If one argument is an integer and the other a floating-point value, as
in `2.0 + 2` and `2 + 2.0`, then the integer is promoted to a floating
point value and floating-point arithmetic is used.

Integer arithmetic behaves slightly differently than floating point
arithmetic.  The first difference is how overflow is treated.  If the
sum or product of two integers overflows the maximum integer
representable, the result is an undesirable wraparound behavior at the
bit level.  If the integers were first promoted to real numbers, they
would not overflow a floating-point representation.  There are no
extra checks in Stan to flag overflows, so it is up to the user to
make sure it does not occur.

Secondly, because the set of integers is not closed under division and
there is no special infinite value for integers, integer division
implicitly rounds the result.  If both arguments are positive, the
result is rounded down.  For example, `1 / 2` evaluates to 0 and `5 /
3` evaluates to 1.

If one of the integer arguments to division is negative, the latest
C++ specification ( C++11), requires rounding toward zero.  This would
have `1 / 2` and `-1 / 2` evaluate to 0, `-7 / 2` evaluate to -3, and
`7 / 2` evaluate to 3.  Before the  C++11 specification, the behavior
was platform dependent, allowing rounding up or down.  All compilers
recent enough to be able to deal with Stan's templating should follow
the  C++11 specification, but it may be worth testing if you are not
sure and plan to use integer division with negative values.

Unlike floating point division, where `1.0 / 0.0` produces the special
positive infinite value, integer division by zero, as in `1 / 0`, has
undefined behavior in the  C++ standard.  For example, the clang++
compiler on Mac OS X returns 3764, whereas the g++ compiler throws an
exception and aborts the program with a warning.  As with overflow, it
is up to the user to make sure integer divide-by-zero does not occur.

### Binary Infix Operators

Operators are described using the  C++ syntax.  For instance, the
binary operator of addition, written `X + Y`, would have the Stan
signature `int operator+(int,int)` indicating it takes two real
arguments and returns a real value.  As noted previously, the value of
integer division is platform-dependent when rounding is platform
dependent before C++11;  the descriptions below provide the C++11
definition.

<!-- operator_add -->
<!-- int; operator+; (int x, int y); -->

`int` **`operator+`**(`int x, int y`)
 The sum of the addends x and y \[ \text{operator+}(x,y) = (x + y) \] 

<!-- operator_subtract -->
<!-- int; operator-; (int x, int y); -->

`int` **`operator-`**(`int x, int y`)
 The difference between the minuend x and subtrahend y \[
\text{operator-}(x,y) = (x - y) \]

<!-- operator_multiply -->
<!-- int; operator*; (int x, int y); -->

`int` **`operator*`**(`int x, int y`)
 The product of the factors x and y \[ \text{operator*}(x,y) = (x
\times y) \]

<!-- operator_divide -->
<!-- int; operator/; (int x, int y); -->

`int` **`operator/`**(`int x, int y`)
 The integer quotient of the dividend x and divisor y \[
\text{operator/}(x,y) = \begin{cases} \lfloor x / y \rfloor & \text{if
} x / y \geq 0 \\ - \lfloor \text{floor}(-x / y) \rfloor & \text{if }
x / y < 0. \end{cases} \]

<!-- operator_mod -->
<!-- int; operator%; (int x, int y); -->

`int` **`operator%`**(`int x, int y`)
x modulo y, which is the positive remainder after dividing x by y. If
both x and y are non-negative, so is the result; otherwise, the sign
of the result is platform dependent. \[ \mathrm{operator\%}(x, y) \ =
\ x \ \text{mod} \ y \ = \ x - y * \lfloor x / y \rfloor \]

### Unary Prefix Operators

<!-- operator_subtract -->
<!-- int; operator-; (int x); -->

`int` **`operator-`**(`int x`)
 The negation of the subtrahend x \[ \text{operator-}(x) = -x 

<!-- operator_add -->
<!-- int; operator+; (int x); -->

`int` **`operator+`**(`int x`)
 This is a no-op. \[ \text{operator+}(x) = x \] 

## Absolute Functions

<!-- abs -->
<!-- R; abs; (T x); -->

`R` **`abs`**(`T x`)
absolute value of x

<!-- int_step -->
<!-- int; int_step; (int x); -->

`int` **`int_step`**(`int x`)


<!-- int; int_step; (real x); -->

`int` **`int_step`**(`real x`)
 Returns the step function of x as an integer, \[
\mathrm{int\_step}(x) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } x > 0 \\ 0 &
\text{if } x \leq 0 \text{ or } x \text{ is } NaN \end{cases} \]
_**Warning:**_ `int_step(0)` and `int_step(NaN)` return 0 whereas
`step(0)` and `step(NaN)` return 1.

See the warning in section \@ref(step-functions) about the dangers of
step functions applied to anything other than data.

## Bound Functions

<!-- min -->
<!-- int; min; (int x, int y); -->

`int` **`min`**(`int x, int y`)
 Returns the minimum of x and y. \[ \text{min}(x, y) = \begin{cases} x
& \text{if } x < y\\ y & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \]

<!-- max -->
<!-- int; max; (int x, int y); -->

`int` **`max`**(`int x, int y`)
 Returns the maximum of x and y. \[ \text{max}(x, y) = \begin{cases} x
& \text{if } x > y\\ y & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \]
